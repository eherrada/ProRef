**Product Manager:** Let's review the tickets for this sprint. We have several user stories related to the authentication system.

**Tech Lead:** I see we have a ticket about implementing two-factor authentication. This will require integration with our existing user management system.

**QA Engineer:** For the 2FA implementation, we'll need to test various scenarios - SMS delivery, backup codes, and edge cases like expired tokens.

**Product Manager:** Good point. We should also consider the user experience flow. The login process shouldn't be too cumbersome.

**Tech Lead:** There's also a bug ticket about password reset emails not being delivered. This might be related to our email service configuration.

**QA Engineer:** I can help test the email delivery once the fix is implemented. We should verify it works across different email providers.

**Product Manager:** Perfect. Let's also discuss the API documentation updates that are needed for the new endpoints.
